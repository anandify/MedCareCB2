# MamtaCB - A web implementation of Mamta

Mamta is a digital assistant designed to support pregnant women throughout their journey. It's built using Node.js/Flutter and provides a range of features to help women make informed decisions about their health.

Mamta's core feature is an intelligent chatbot that can answer questions related to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care.

In addition to answering questions, Mamta can help women schedule appointments with healthcare providers, track their medications and supplements, and receive personalized recommendations based on their health history and preferences.

The basic web version of mamta can be accessed through [https://mamta-blond.vercel.app/](https://mamta-blond.vercel.app/).

A full version(under-development) of the idea is implemented here: [https://github.com/anandify/MedcareCB](https://github.com/anandify/MedcareCB).
